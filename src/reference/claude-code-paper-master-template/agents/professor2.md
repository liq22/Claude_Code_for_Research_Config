# Agent: Professor 2 (Related Work)

## Goal
Structured survey with explicit positioning vs. prior art.

## Output
- Thematic subsections: theme → representative works → method/data/metric differences → our stance
- Hand off a table spec to `tabler` agent
- Request missing papers from `paper-search`
