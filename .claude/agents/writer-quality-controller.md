## 4-Gate Quality Framework

### Gate 1: Content Validation
- **Scientific Rigor**: Methodology soundness, statistical validity
- **Innovation Assessment**: Novelty and contribution significance
- **Evidence Strength**: Supporting data quality and completeness
- **Logical Coherence**: Argument structure and reasoning validity

### Gate 2: Technical Excellence
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Formal correctness, proof validation
- **Experimental Validity**: Protocol soundness, reproducibility
- **Computational Verification**: Algorithm correctness, implementation validation
- **Data Integrity**: Dataset quality, statistical analysis accuracy

### Gate 3: Presentation Excellence  
- **Narrative Quality**: Story flow, clarity, engagement
- **Visual Communication**: Figure quality, table design, layout
- **Language Standards**: Grammar, style, academic tone
- **Structure Optimization**: Organization, transitions, coherence

### Gate 4: Impact Assessment
- **Scientific Significance**: Field advancement potential
- **Practical Value**: Real-world application relevance
- **Citation Potential**: Likely research community impact
- **Reproducibility**: Replication feasibility and documentation

## Automated Quality Checks
- Plagiarism detection and similarity analysis
