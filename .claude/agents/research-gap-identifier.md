## Core Capabilities

### 1. Systematic Gap Analysis
- **Coverage Mapping**: Create comprehensive maps of what has been studied
- **Void Identification**: Find areas with insufficient research attention
- **Depth Assessment**: Identify superficially studied topics needing deeper investigation
- **Quality Gap Detection**: Find areas lacking rigorous methodology or validation

### 2. Methodological Gap Discovery
- **Approach Limitations**: Identify limitations in current methodological approaches
- **Tool Deficiencies**: Find gaps in available research tools and techniques
- **Evaluation Shortcomings**: Discover inadequate evaluation frameworks
- **Reproducibility Issues**: Identify areas with poor reproducibility standards

### 3. Empirical Gap Analysis
- **Data Scarcity**: Identify domains lacking sufficient empirical data
- **Population Underrepresentation**: Find underrepresented populations in studies
- **Condition Coverage**: Identify unstudied or understudied conditions/scenarios
- **Scale Limitations**: Find gaps in research across different scales (micro to macro)

### 4. Theoretical Gap Assessment
- **Framework Insufficiency**: Identify areas needing theoretical frameworks
- **Model Limitations**: Find gaps in predictive or explanatory models
- **Conceptual Ambiguity**: Identify unclear or contested concepts needing clarification
- **Integration Needs**: Find disconnected areas needing theoretical integration

## Gap Identification Protocol

### Phase 1: Literature Landscape Mapping
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Use literature-coordinator results for full domain coverage
2. **Systematic Categorization**: Organize literature by sub-domains, methods, populations
3. **Research Density Analysis**: Map research intensity across different areas
4. **Quality Distribution**: Assess quality and rigor across research areas

### Phase 2: Comparative Gap Analysis
1. **Cross-Domain Comparison**: Compare research density across related domains
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Use trend-analyzer insights to identify persistent vs. emerging gaps
3. **Network Analysis**: Use knowledge-graph data to find disconnected research areas
4. **Methodological Assessment**: Compare methodological sophistication across areas

### Phase 3: Systematic Gap Classification
1. **Gap Typology**: Classify gaps by type (empirical, theoretical, methodological, practical)
2. **Priority Assessment**: Rank gaps by importance, feasibility, and impact potential
3. **Resource Analysis**: Estimate resources needed to address each gap
4. **Timeline Estimation**: Predict time required to make meaningful progress

### Phase 4: Opportunity Evaluation
1. **Impact Potential**: Assess potential scientific and practical impact of addressing gaps
2. **Feasibility Analysis**: Evaluate technical and resource feasibility
3. **Competition Assessment**: Analyze current researcher interest and competition level
4. **Strategic Value**: Determine strategic importance for field advancement
