# Agent Goal Management System

This directory contains the goal management system for the 18-agent Claude Code research configuration.

## Core Files

### `agent_goals.yaml`
Comprehensive goal definitions for all 18 agents including:
- Core mission statements
- Success criteria (measurable objectives)
- Key performance metrics
- Target performance scores

### `goal_tracking.json`
Performance tracking data generated automatically:
- Historical performance records
- Current metrics for each agent
- Trend analysis data
- Achievement progress tracking

### `performance_metrics.json` (Auto-generated)
Detailed performance metrics storage for system analytics and reporting.

## Goal System Architecture

### Agent Categories

**Research Agents (7)**
- `research-literature`: Literature discovery and synthesis
- `research-knowledge-graph`: Knowledge network construction
- `research-hypothesis`: AI-driven hypothesis generation
- `research-gap-identifier`: Systematic gap identification
- `research-trends`: Research trend analysis and prediction
- `research-academic`: Academic literature search and analysis
- `research-semantic-scholar`: Semantic Scholar API optimization

**Writer Agents (8)**
- `writer-intro-cluster`: Introduction writing (5-in-1 cluster)
- `writer-method-cluster`: Methodology documentation (5-in-1 cluster)

### Goal Structure

Each agent has:
```yaml
mission: "Clear, measurable objective statement"
success_criteria:
  - "Specific success indicator 1"
  - "Specific success indicator 2"
key_metrics:
  - metric_name_1
  - metric_name_2
target_scores:
  metric_name_1: 0.90  # 90% target
  metric_name_2: 0.85  # 85% target
```

## Management Scripts

### Goal Manager (`scripts/agent_management/goal_manager.py`)
```bash
# Initialize goal system
python scripts/agent_management/goal_manager.py init

# Check system status
python scripts/agent_management/goal_manager.py status

# Generate goal achievement report
python scripts/agent_management/goal_manager.py report --agent research-literature

# Update agent performance metrics
python scripts/agent_management/goal_manager.py update --agent research-literature
```

### Task Tracker (`scripts/agent_management/task_tracker.py`)
```bash
# View task analytics
python scripts/agent_management/task_tracker.py analytics --agent research-literature

# Get task recommendations
python scripts/agent_management/task_tracker.py recommend --agent research-literature

# Export task data
python scripts/agent_management/task_tracker.py export --format json
```

### Summary Generator (`scripts/agent_management/summary_generator.py`)
```bash
# List agent summaries
python scripts/agent_management/summary_generator.py list --agent research-literature

# Search summaries
python scripts/agent_management/summary_generator.py search --query "literature review"

# Generate agent report
python scripts/agent_management/summary_generator.py report --agent research-literature
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics by Agent Type

**Research Agents**
- `relevance_score`: Relevance of found information
- `coverage_completeness`: Comprehensive domain coverage
- `time_efficiency`: Speed of task completion
- `user_satisfaction`: User feedback scores

**Writer Agents**
- `narrative_quality`: Story and flow quality
- `technical_accuracy`: Mathematical and scientific precision
- `format_compliance`: Journal requirement adherence
- `readability_score`: Accessibility and clarity

**Coder Agents**
- `vulnerability_detection`: Security issue identification
- `performance_optimization`: Code efficiency improvement
- `production_readiness`: Deployment preparedness
- `best_practices_compliance`: Industry standard adherence

### Success Thresholds

- **Excellent**: 90%+ average across all metrics
- **Good**: 80-89% average across all metrics
- **Needs Improvement**: <80% average across all metrics

## Integration Points

### With Logging System
- Goals integrated with execution logs
- Performance metrics tracked automatically
- Task completion tied to goal achievement

### With Agent Files
- Goal sections added to each agent definition
- Goal-oriented execution protocols
- Automatic goal alignment checking

### With Hook System
- Pre-execute: Goal context setting
- Post-execute: Performance metric update
- Session management: Goal progress tracking

## Usage Examples

### Check Overall System Health
```bash
python scripts/agent_management/goal_manager.py status
```

### Monitor Specific Agent Performance
```bash
python scripts/agent_management/goal_manager.py report --agent research-literature --days 30
```

### Analyze Task Patterns
```bash
python scripts/agent_management/task_tracker.py analytics --days 60
```

### Generate Performance Report
```bash
python scripts/agent_management/summary_generator.py report --agent writer-intro-cluster --days 30
```

## Continuous Improvement

The goal system enables continuous improvement through:

1. **Performance Tracking**: Automatic metric collection
2. **Trend Analysis**: Pattern identification over time
3. **Success Learning**: Capture of effective strategies
4. **Gap Identification**: Detection of underperforming areas
5. **Optimization**: Data-driven improvement recommendations

## Benefits
